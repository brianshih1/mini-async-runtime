# Prerequisites - Rust Primitives

We will be using Rust primitives heavily to support asynchronous operations. In this section, I will perform a quick summary of Rust primitives including `Future`, `Async/Await`, and `Waker`.

If you are already familiar with these primitives, feel free to skip this section. If you want a more thorough explanation of these primitives, I recommend these two blogs: [async/.await Primer](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/01_getting_started/04_async_await_primer.html) and Philipp Oppermannâ€™s [Async/Await blog](https://os.phil-opp.com/async-await/).
